<h1 align="center">Our Goals</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goal with Caregiver Connect is to create a service that would allow dementia patients and their caregivers the ability to search for caregiving services around them in the state of Alabama. We also would like to allow the community 
to be able to post any services that they find to Caregiver Connect.
